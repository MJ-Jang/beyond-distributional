@dataclass
class DataCollatorForMultipleChoice:
    """
    Data collator that will dynamically pad the inputs for multiple choice received.

    Args:
        tokenizer (:class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer` or :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast`):
            The tokenizer used for encoding the data.
        padding (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.tokenization_utils_base.PaddingStrategy`,
            `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):
            Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding index)
            among:

            * :obj:`True` or :obj:`'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
              sequence if provided).
            * :obj:`'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument :obj:`max_length` or to the
              maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
            * :obj:`False` or :obj:`'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of
              different lengths).
        max_length (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
            Maximum length of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).
        pad_to_multiple_of (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

            This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability >=
            7.5 (Volta).
