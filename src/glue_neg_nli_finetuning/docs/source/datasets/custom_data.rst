Custom Data Files
=================

In most cases when training/validating/testing on custom files, youâ€™ll be able to do so without modifying any code, using the general data module classes directly.

Below we show per task how to fine-tune/validate/test on your own files per task or modify the logic within the data classes. Some tasks are more involved than others, as they may require more data processing.
